# Reading-Assistant-NLP-Project

You have a collection of texts that is rich in geographical entities, explicitly marked XML, and the texts are accompanied by metadata describing: the author and title of the book, the year of publication and the publisher. The app will signal your phone's proximity to the locations mentioned in the texts and read you those snippets that include those mentions. In this way, a walk through a big city can turn into a literary journey.
